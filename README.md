### Welcome to Eventagious!

This app is a social media and networking tool built for event professionals - DJs, emcees, photographers, stylists, security specialists, videographers, etc - to link up with one another as well as book events through event planners and coordinators via the app.

With this mobile-friendly app, users have the ability to register an account, build a detailed profile with their areas of expertise and social media links, search for other users based on location or event specialty, create social media posts, or comment/like/unlike other users' posts.
